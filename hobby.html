			<div class="subtitle">·PAINTING</div>
			<br><span class="first">I have</span> been loving painting and drawing since very young. As growing up, I started to use professional painting tools, which gave me a sense of satisfaction. <br>
			<span class="first">Basically,</span> I prefer watercolor(水彩)and acrylic(丙烯). The former has the quality of translucence. The more water you add to the pigment, the lighter color it will be. However, the acrylic is much thicker. I just have a favor of the two texture. <br>
			<span class="first">The things</span> that I like to paint best are characters and snacks.
